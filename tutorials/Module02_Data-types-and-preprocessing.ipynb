    "such as the potential difference (voltage) between an electrode placed in a brain area of interest and a reference.\n",

    "we obtain a measurement, \n",
    "indicated by the black dots. \n",
    "We are blind to any changes in between the samples, \n",
    "illustrated by the unbroken line. \n",

    "a video camera records a signal in each of many pixels, and so on.\n",
