    Parameters
    ----------
    tuning : list of np.arrays
        Where each inner array contains the tuning curves for an
        individual neuron.
    hz_thresh : int or float
        Any bin with firing above this value is considered to be part of a field.
    min_length : int
        Minimum length of field (in tuning curve bin units, eg. if bin size is 3cm,
        min_length=1 is 3cm.
    max_length : int
        Maximum length of field (in tuning curve bin units, eg. if bin size is 3cm,
        min_length=10 is 3cm*10 = 30cm.
    max_mean_firing : int or float
        Only neurons with a mean firing rate less than this amount are considered for
        having place fields. The default is set to 10.

    Returns
