    "- **Code.**\n",
    "Repositories (folders) here are linked to remote GitHub repositories (either public or private).\n",
    "This may mean that some project code repositories depend on other repositories, \n",

    "Just be aware that you need to keep your code up-to-date in every location \n",
    "where it is used (by doing `git pull`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data.**\n",
    "Data should not be put on GitHub because it takes up a lot of space and never changes, \n",
    "so it does not benefit from being tracked with the version control of git.\n",
    "Raw data should be in a separate location on your computer than where your code lives,\n",
    "but processed data and intermediate files can be in a folder within your project code \n",
    "_as long as you specify git to ignore that location within your .gitignore file_.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are an owner or collaborator of a GitHub repository, \n",
    "such as when you make a repository for your own project,\n",
    "you will be able to push changes you make and manage the repository as you like.\n",
    "Generally, when you want to contribute to another repository, \n",
    "you can make your changes in a Fork of the repository and create a \n",
    "[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).\n",
    "These pull requests allows the maintainers to see your code and ask for changes before it is merged into master,\n",
    "which helps to ensure that the code in master is working and stable."
