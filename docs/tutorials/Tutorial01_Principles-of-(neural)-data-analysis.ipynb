    "\n",
    "This module sketches some of the overall principles for careful neural data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep data and analysis secure using servers and version control\n",
    "2. Look at the data\n",
    "3. Start simple\n",
    "4. Test and document acquisition and analysis code"

    "## 1. Keep data and analysis secure\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the worst things that can happen to researchers is the loss of data or hours/days of analysis.\n",
    "Although there's not much that we can do about floods in the lab or unplanned subject deaths, \n",
    "we can reduce the risk of losing data once it's acquired by saving it in multiple places and on secure servers.\n",
    "You should never use the raw data in your analysis without first making a copy,\n",
    "so that the raw (or promoted) data is always available to return to if needed.\n",
    "This means that when doing an analysis, it should always be on a copy of \"working data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarily, analyses can take a lot of time and effort and should be protected against loss. \n",
    "The best way to do this is to use version control, such as git.\n",
    "Git is a version control system that tracks changes between files and \n",
    "allows you to return to previously committed code.\n",
    "Our lab uses [GitHub](https://github.com/vandermeerlab) to store different analyses."

    "## 2. Look at the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis will be meaningless if performed on bad data. \n",
    "But, even if you start out with good data there are many analysis steps that have the power to corrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be conscious to look at your data at every step to ensure you are working with what you expect. \n",
    "Two habits that help with this are **visualization** (explored in Module03) \n",
    "and **testing** (both unit testing and tests with fake data).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this principle is critical, consider an analogy: \n",
    "a complex multistep experimental procedure such as surgically implanting a recording probe into the brain. \n",
    "In this setting, the surgeon _always_ verifies the success of the previous step before proceeding. \n",
    "It would be disastrous to attempt to insert a delicate probe without making sure the skull bone is removed first; \n",
    "or to apply dental cement to the skull without first making sure the craniotomy is sealed! \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by looking at the raw data to ensure it is as expected, \n",
    "without **contamination** or **missing pieces**.\n",
    "Then, apply the same mindset during your analysis to confirm the success of every step before proceeding."

    "## 3. Start simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the start of data collection, you should identify the major steps in your data processing \"workflow\" \n",
    "-- that is, the flow from raw data to the figures in the resulting publication. \n",
    "Doing this can often highlight key dependencies and important controls \n",
    "that help you collect the data such that you will can thoroughly test what you set out to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of planning is especially important when performing experiments with long timelines,\n",
    "such as when chronically implanting animals for _in vivo_ recording, \n",
    "where it may take up to two months to collect data from a single animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps to this planning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a schematic that illustrates your analysis workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Think in terms of raw data and data transformations to illustrate a workflow at a conceptual level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's create a workflow which seeks \n",
    "to determine whether the number of sharp wave-ripple \n",
    "(SWRs; these are candidate \"replay\" events in the hippocampus)\n",
    "events depend on an experimental manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"00_n-swr.svg\" width=\"300cm\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The above workflow shows how SWR times are derived from the raw local field potential (LFP) data,\n",
    "and the event of interest is a component of all the events. \n",
    "Next, the number of SWR events is determined by finding the overlap between SWR times and the event of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Organize your data analysis workflow into pseudocode that can later be implemented in python\n",
    "\n",
    "For the workflow above, it might look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load LFP (.ncs)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slice lfp to the experiment time of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find SWR epochs using a Hilbert transform with a filter of 150-220Hz on the sliced_lfp\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find epochs during the event_of_interest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find intersection between the swr_epochs and the event_of_interest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Count the number of epochs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this pseudocode, you can determine which parts are best done with a function,\n",
    "and which are easiest to access using a method on the data type.\n",
    "Many of these steps exist as functions or methods in the Nept codebase,\n",
    "but making the analysis steps explicit in this way provides a good foundation for well organized code."
